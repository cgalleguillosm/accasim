CP-based Dispatchers
====================

The dispatchers presented below correspond to the ones used in the paper entitled "Constraint Programming-based Job Dispatching for Modern HPC Applications". All of those dispatchers
use `OR-Tools <https://developers.google.com/optimization/>`_ to model and then solve the dispatching problem, and were implemented to work with the 
`AccaSim <https://accasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ simulator.
